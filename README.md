## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code

### Things to note

While I have covered the basics of all of the CSS used in this project, it was helpful to recap Flexbox as it can be slightly confusing at times. I struggled with centering the element on the screen, as I have a habit of forgetting about using positioning. Hopefully with more CSS practice, it will set in my memory.

### Continued development

In the future, I will be aiming to use both Flexbox and Grid more often where possible so that I can get more comfortable using these techniques. Practicing using proper tagging and semantic markup will be something I try to focus on to help keep my code readable and get in the habit of using good code practices from the beginning.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Flexbox Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I found this Flexbox really helpful in remembering which Flex properties to use on the container versus the items.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - I used Stack Overflow to clarify the reasons for some glitches in the code (the footer appearing above the body, for example, can happen when you set the body positon to fixed or absolute).
